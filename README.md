# NextJS-NFT-Marketplace

A web3 dapp built using nextjs, react, typescript, yailwind and solidity.

Note: we can implement a NFT marketplace in 2 ways:

1. Contract based: where the contract itself is the marketplace and holds all the NFTs.
2. Off-chain: where the NFTs owners hold their NFTs and the marketplace is just a platform to trade them. and owners can give/revoke access to their NFTs to the marketplace.

### Our approach is the second one.
